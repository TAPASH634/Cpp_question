/*Beginner*/

1.Reverse a String: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string in reverse order.


Input: "hello"

Output: "olleh"

2.Check for Palindrome: Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward).

Input: "racecar"

Output: True

3.Count Vowels in a String: Write a function to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.

Input: "hello world"

Output: 3

4.Find the Length of the Longest Word: Write a function that finds the length of the longest word in a given string.


Input: "I love programming"

Output: 11 (length of "programming")

5.Remove Duplicates from a String: Write a function that removes duplicate characters from a string while preserving the order.


Input: "aabbccdde"

Output: "abcde"

/*Intermediate*/

6.Find All Substrings: Write a function that returns all possible substrings of a given string.


Input: "abc"

Output: ["a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"]

7.Check if Two Strings are Anagrams: Write a function that checks if two given strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in different order).


Input: "listen", "silent"

Output: True

8.Find the First Non-Repeating Character: Write a function that finds the first character in a string that does not repeat.

Input: "swiss"

Output: "w"


9.String Compression: Implement a basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string is longer than the original, return the original.


Input: "aabcccccaaa"

Output: "a2b1c5a3"
